# Spring Boot REST API Practice Projects

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **REST API** using **Spring Boot** with **Spring Data JPA** to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The **Lombok** library is used to reduce boilerplate code for entity classes. The project uses  **MySQL Workbench** for database management. The project was developed in **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**, and **Postman** was used to test the API endpoints.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA** (for CRUD operations)
- **Lombok**
- **MySQL Workbench**
- **Postman** (for API testing)
- **Maven**
- **Java**

## Features
- Full CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA (without manually coding CRUD methods)
- Lombok to simplify entity classes with auto-generated getters, setters, constructors, etc.
- MySQL database integration using Spring Data JPA
- API testing with Postman
